<p>By using this site, you agree to the Privacy Policy of wwiTV. If you do not agree to the Policy, please do not use this site. 
wwiTV reviews its privacy policy periodically and reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify or remove portions of this policy at any time. 
This page should be reviewed periodically so that you are updated on any changes. If you want to communicate with us about our policy, 
please e-mail us at: info@wwitv.com <br><br>wwiTV, which operates the Internet site located at wwiTV.com recognizes the importance of protecting the 
privacy of personally identifiable information collected about visitors to our sites. As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, 
such as your name, address or email address, is automatically collected from visitors to our site. Personally identifiable information about visitors
 to our site is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted. We may collect certain non-personal information to optimize our Web pages for 
 your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, your IP address and the domain name of your Internet
 service provider). We may use such non-personal information for internal purposes, including but not limited to improving the content of our sites. 
 In those instances when we do collect personally identifiable information, the following policies apply: wwiTV will notify you when we are collecting 
 personally identifiable information about you and how we intend to use it. For example, we may need to collect such information to provide you with 
 information you requested, in connection with entry forms, or in connection with community postings such as chat and bulletin boards. <br><br>
 Personally identifiable information that visitors submit to our sites is used only for the purpose for which it is submitted unless we disclose 
 other uses in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection. Such other uses may include sending you information or materials we think you will
 find interesting, or sharing the information with wwiTV's Media's advertisers and reputable business partners. However, at the time of collection, 
 you will have the option of instructing us not to send you additional information or share your personal information with third parties. 
 wwiTV is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of our business partners. wwiTV may use reputable third parties to manage activities 
 available on our sites including, but not limited to statistical analysis, or chats. These parties may have access to personally identifiable information 
 submitted by visitors who participate in those activities. Similarly, we may contract with third parties to handle the fulfillment of subscriptions or 
 requests for information you submit to our sites, such as sending you a newsletter. In most instances, wwiTV instructs these third parties to use personally 
 identifiable information only for the specific purpose for which it is collected, and not to sell, market or transfer such information to other entities.<br><br>
 If wwiTV obtains personal information that has been collected from you by a third party, including our business partners, this Privacy Policy nonetheless 
 governs wwiTV's use of that information. Please remember that any information posted on bulletin boards and/or communicated in chat areas becomes public information. 
 You should use caution when sharing information as any of it can be collected and used by people you may not know. Users under the age of 18 should be particularly 
 careful not to divulge any personal information. While wwiTV strives to protect and respect your privacy, we can not guarantee the security of any information you 
 disclose in a chat room or bulletin board and you do so at your own risk.<br><br>
 wwiTV does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Personal information may be disclosed in special 
 situations where wwiTV has reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or 
 interfering (intentionally or unintentionally) with wwiTV's rights, property, users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Also, wwiTV may 
 reveal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.wwiTV maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy 
 of personally identifiable information submitted to our site, and periodically reviews and updates its security measures in light of current technologies. 
 Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. Although wwiTV strives to protect your personal information, 
 we can not ensure or warranty the security of any information you may transmit to us. This is done so at your own risk. Once we do receive your transmission, 
 however, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.<br><br>
